# Stage 1: Basic Class Design (Constructors + Getters/Setters)

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to define a **C++ class**, use **constructors**, and create **getters/setters** to manage data securely using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

---

## 🧩 Task Description
In this stage, you will create a `Student` class that demonstrates the use of **constructors**, **data encapsulation**, and **member functions**.

### Class Requirements
**Private Data Members:**
- `string name`
- `int rollNumber`
- `float gpa`

**Public Member Functions:**
1. **Default Constructor** – Initializes data members with default values.  
2. **Parameterized Constructor** – Initializes data members with user-provided values.  
3. **Getters and Setters** – Provides access and modification of private members safely.  
4. **Display() Function** – Displays all student details neatly.

## 🧾 Expected Output
Student Name: Ali
Roll Number: 101
GPA: 3.45

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Understand how **constructors** initialize class objects.  
- Learn how to use **getters and setters** for encapsulation.  
- Practice **basic class design** principles in C++.  

---

## 🛠️ Instructions
1. Define the class and implement all required member functions.  
2. Create an object of the `Student` class in `main()`.  
3. Test both constructors and display student information.  
4. Ensure your program follows clean and readable formatting.
